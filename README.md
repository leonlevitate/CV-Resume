| **Problem-solving**        | Learning and applying **Test-Driven Development** has enabled me to logically assess user requirements and improve my approach to writing clean code. I've outlined my high-level TDD process for one of my earlier projects [here](https://github.com/leonlevitate/boris_bikes).                                                                                                |
| **Adaptability**           | At Orbus Software, I worked cross-functionally with Consultants, Developers and Support Engineers. Through my natural curiosity and can-do attitude, I'm able to study and master new tasks and knowledge. [Below](#recommendation) is a recommendation from my previous line manager at Orbus Software.                                                                         |
| **Team-focused**           | Being a dynamic and engaged team-player comes naturally to me. I'm often praised on my calm and rational demeanour when dealing with any roadblocks or conflicts within the team. [Here](https://github.com/petraartep/acebook-rails-team-squirrel/wiki/Day-1) is a team diary for our Acebook project which reflects on our journey working together as a cohesive team.        |
| **Self-motivated learner** | My previous roles have required a high degree of autonomy, trust and tenacity, which has earned me several promotions to senior positions throughout my career. I've acheived this by setting personal and professional goals, developing strong self-awareness, and continuous reflection/evaluation of my learning and progress.
