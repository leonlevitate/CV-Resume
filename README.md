| **Problem-solving**        | Learning and practicing Test-driven development has enabled me to logically assess user requirements and improve my approach to writing clean code. [Here](https://github.com/leonlevitate/boris_bikes) I outline my general TDD process for one of my earlier projects.                                                                                                                   |
| **Adaptability**           | At Orbus Software, I worked cross-functionally with Consultants, Developers and Support Engineers. Through my natural curiosity and can-do attitude, I'm able to master new tasks and knowledge. [Below](#recommendation) is a recommendation from my previous line manager at Orbus Software.                                                                                             |
| **Team-focused**           | Being a strong and engaged team-player comes naturally to me. I'm often praised on my calm and focused demeanour when dealing with any roadblocks or conflicts within the team. [Here](https://github.com/petraartep/acebook-rails-team-squirrel/wiki/Day-1) is a team diary for our Acebook project which outlines what worked well, what didn't work, and what could have been improved. |
| **Self-motivated learner** | My previous roles have required a high degree of autonomy, trust and tenacity. This has earned me several promotions to senior positions throughout my career. I've acheived this by setting personal and professional goals, maintaining good self-awareness, and continuously reflecting and evaluating my learning and progress.
